## Understanding forest composition is a valuable aspect of managing the health and vitality of our wilderness areas. 
Classifying cover type can help further research regarding forest fire susceptibility and de/re-forestation concerns.
Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. 
Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).

## Summary Statistics
1. Number of instances (observations)	581012
2. Number of Attributes	54
3. Attribute breakdown	12 measures, but 54 columns of data (10 quantitative variables, 4 binary wilderness areas and 40 binary soil type variables)
4. Missing Attribute Values	None
5. Variable Information

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
